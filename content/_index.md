  How to use the CERNBox File-picker in your site.
---

Welcome to the File-picker docs.

## What does the File-picker does?

The CERNBox File-picker provides a way to integrate the cloud storage into other
applications.

It can be embedded in a web, and will show a file browser which allows the users
to navigate their CERNBox storage. Once the user has made a selection, URLs for
the selected files will be provided to the parent.

The File-picker handles authentication into CERNBox itself, and the URLs include
a token to grant access for the parent application.

## How to use it

Here is a small guide to integrate CERNBox in a site using the File-picker.

- How to [embed the file-picker in your site](embedding).
- How to [get files from CERNBox](data) once the user has selected some.
- How to [style the file-picker](style).
